# Vigilance+

Vigilance+ is a computer vision-based identity card scanning security system designed to provide secure access management for colleges, residential colonies, and similar premises. The system leverages advanced technologies like image processing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Large Language Models (LLM) to automate identity verification.

## Features
- **Automated Identity Verification:** Utilizes computer vision to scan identity cards, perform image processing, and extract text using OCR.
- **Contextual Information Extraction:** Employs LLM to interpret and validate the extracted data for enhanced security and accuracy.
- **Seamless Integration:** Designed to integrate easily into existing access management systems.
- **Real-time Processing:** Provides fast and accurate identity verification with minimal delay.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Can be deployed across multiple locations with centralized data management.

## Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision:** For card scanning and image processing.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** For text extraction from identity cards.
- **LLM (Large Language Model):** For extracting contextual meaning and validating identity details.
- **Python, OpenCV:** Core technologies for image processing and computer vision.
- **Tesseract OCR:** Open-source library for text extraction.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** For LLM-based information interpretation.


## Usage
- Upload an image of the identity card through the interface.
- The system will scan the card, extract text, and validate the information using LLM.
- Verified identities will be logged for access management.
